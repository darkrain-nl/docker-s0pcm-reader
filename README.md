S0PCM-Reader
============

This is the Docker setup for the S0PCM-Reader application. This small Python application reads the pulse counters of a S0PCM-2 or S0PCM-5 and send the total and daily counters via MQTT to your favorite domotica application like Home Assistant. The S0PCM-2 or 5 are the S0 Pulse Counter Module sold by http://www.smartmeterdashboard.nl

I myself use it to count my water meter usage.

Pulse vs liter vs m3
--------------------
I use the S0PCM-Reader to measure my water meter and normally in the Netherlands the water usage is measurement in m3 and not in liters. Only this S0PCM-Reader isn't really aware of liters vs m3, because it counts the pulses. So it is important for you to check how your e.g. water meter is counting the usage, my Itron water meter send 1 pulse per liter of water. This then means the 'measurement.yaml' file, which stores the total and daily counters, all should be in liters and not in m3.

The conversion from m3 to liter is easy, because you can just multiple it by 1000. E.g. 770.123 m3 is 770123 liter.

Initial Configuration
---------------------

To use the S0PCM-Reader you need to configure it, this can be done in 2 ways:
- Start the S0PCM-Reader and the default configuration will be copied into the `/config` folder
- Download the example `configuration.yaml` with the following command (we use `wget` for this) into your `/config` folder:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ualex73/docker-s0pcm-reader/master/app/configuration.yaml.example`

Configure your initial meter reader
-----------------------------------
After you have downloaded and started the S0PCM-Reader, you need to configure your total pulse count to allow the S0PCM-Reader to relay the correct total count. Follow the following procedure:
- Stop the S0PCM-Reader container
- Open the `<config>/measurement.yaml` file
- Check which input you use, e.g. for input 'M1' modify the following:
```
1:
  total: 370689
```
- Save the file
- Start the S0PCM-Reader container

MQTT Message
------------
The totals and day counters will be published with the following topics:

```
<basetopic>/1/total
<basetopic>/1/today
<basetopic>/1/yesterday
<basetopic>/2/total
<basetopic>/2/today
<basetopic>/2/yesterday
<basetopic>/X/total
<basetopic>/X/today
<basetopic>/X/yesterday
```
The `<basetopic>` you can configure in the `mqtt` section of the configuration file, the default is 's0pcm-reader'. The `X` is the input number, the name is configurable in the measurement file.

S0PCM
-----
The following S0PCM (ascii) protocol is used by this S0PCM-Reader, a simple S0PCM telegram:
```
Header record (once, after start-up):
/a: S0 Pulse Counter V0.6 - 30/30/30/30/30ms

Data record (repeated every interval):
For S0PCM-5: ID:a:I:b:M1:c:d:M2:e:f:M3:g:h:M4:i:j:M5:k:l
For S0PCM-2: ID:a:I:b:M1:c:d:M2:e:f

Legenda:
a -> Unique ID of the S0PCM
b -> interval between two telegrams in seconds, this is set in the firmware at 10 seconds.
c/e/g/i/k -> number of pulses in the last interval of register 1/2/3/4/5
d/f/h/j/l/ -> number of pulses since the last start-up of register 1/2/3/4/5

Data example:
/8237:S0 Pulse Counter V0.6 - 30/30/30/30/30ms
ID:8237:I:10:M1:0:0:M2:0:0:M3:0:0:M4:0:0:M5:0:0
```

Also the S0PCM-Reader uses the following serialport configuration (used by S0PCM-2 and S0PCM-5):
```
Speed: 9600 baud
Parity: Even
Databits: 7
Stopbit: 1
Xon/Xoff: No
Rts/Cts: No
```

If you own a different type of S0PCM device, which you like to have supported, please contact me.
